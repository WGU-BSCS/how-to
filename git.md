# Contribute to a project:
## Read the README.md on the project and it should specify whether to (or both):
1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)

## Every time you want to make a [local](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13072111/gits-local-repository-and-remote-repository-confusing-concepts) change and push it to the remote repository:
1. [Pull or Fetch](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/)
2. Resolve conflicts, if any
3. Switch to the appropriate branch
3. Add/edit, save <--- these are all local changes
4. Stage
5. Commit - add commit message
6. Push
7. Open Pull Request
8. Make requested changes, save, stage, commit, push -> repeat until there are no more change requests from the maintainers. Important: there's NO need to open new pull requests as you push your updates. The whole PR workflow is centered around this idea that new commits you push will be added to the same open PR until it is ready to be merged in to the main project.
